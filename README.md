**About the app**:

It loads and displays Positive News data from the Reddit API. Users have the possibility to bookmark News Items and block News Sources.

Includes swipe to refresh, search and pagination.

Given that the app needs to load data in a Webview, this app has limited offline usage.

Clean and Simple UI.

**Will include dark theme in the future.**

**Will also include more tests.**
